<h1>About Me</h1> 
  <p>I’m currently studying IT Systems Support (NQF Level 5) and taking my first steps into the world of coding. My growing interest in technology drives me to understand both the practical side of IT support and the logic behind software development.</p> <p>In my IT Systems Support training, I’ve gained hands-on experience with troubleshooting, system maintenance, and supporting users across various platforms. I enjoy problem-solving and take pride in helping others navigate technical challenges with patience and clarity.</p> 
  <p>As a beginner in coding, I'm learning the foundations of programming and exploring how software works behind the scenes. I’m particularly excited about how these skills can expand my ability to build, automate, and improve systems in real-world environments.</p> 
  <p>I’m passionate about continuous learning and committed to growing my skills in both IT support and software development. My goal is to become a well-rounded IT professional who can support, innovate, and contribute to efficient tech-driven solutions.</p>
